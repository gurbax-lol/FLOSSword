# FLOSSword
The open-source password manager that works completely offline! It keeps your secrets as safe as your grandma's recipes. No need for the cloud, this little desktop app puts you in control of your privacy! You'll never have to worry about your passwords falling into the wrong hands - unless, of course, those hands belong to your nosy roommate.
